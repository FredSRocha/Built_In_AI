# ðŸ¤– AURA: Time Flowing With You...

To ensure daily productivity, it is ideal that tasks are completed as soon as possible; therefore, our WEB APPLICATION is ideal for short-term scheduling. Use Aura - Time that flows with you!

## ðŸ’¥ The Problem

The challenge is the disorganization and cognitive overload I face when dealing with multiple daily commitments. Today, traditional calendar applications require the user to manually enter every detail, which can be laborious and unintuitive.

## âœ¨ The Solution

A multimodal intelligent assistant for scheduling tasks via audio or post-it note (image) using the Prompt API and Gemini Nano in Firebase AI Logic to ensure a hybrid user experience, processing data locally or in the cloud.

## ðŸ¤” How Does It Work?

On Chrome-compatible devices (On-device AI), processing uses the Prompt API and Gemini Nano on the user's device. On browsers or systems without built-in AI support compatible with Chrome (Cloud AI / Fallback), Firebase AI Logic performs processing through Cloud AI, offering the user a consistent experience across different environments.

## ðŸ›¡ Is It Safe To Use?

**Yes!!!** This **WEB APPLICATION** stores tasks locally via IndexedDB, and AI processing (Built-in or Cloud) is used only to ensure structured output of information via JSON for analysis and dynamic consumption in the user interface.

**AI CONFLICT RESOLUTION:** When AI identifies date/time conflicts in tasks, it acts autonomously and determines the best time without human intervention. Example: If the task: _"Take my cat to get vaccinated at 11 am"_ is added, but there is a scheduled business meeting, then this appointment is registered at a different time.

**Why Aura?**

- Fast, intuitive, and multimodal input (voice + image).
- Hybrid AI processing for flexibility and reliability.
- Conflict-free scheduling without manual intervention.
- Optimized for short-term productivity and daily task flow.

_Simplify your day. Focus on what matters._
